.. Due to something, the manpages generated by sphnix do not display the
   (sub)sections UNLESS there is a !(sub)section defined. Luckly, that
   !(sub)section is invisible in the manpage.
   Sphinx (sphinx-build) 1.2.3 & 1.4.5

.. We take advantage to that fact to put manpages with the correct title
   in other documents, but this means that we are relying on a bug.
