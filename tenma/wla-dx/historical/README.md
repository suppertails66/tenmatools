This directory contains tools subdirectories which used to live at WLA DX's root.
They are kept here for historical purposes until one of the following conditions
are met:

* They are merged back into the source tree in a seamless manner (legacy Makefiles,
which will need to be generated, and then transported to a legacy machine for
building).
* We determine certain tools are redundant and/or genuinely not needed anymore.

Makefiles/scripts in these directories are not guaranteed to work without modifications,
as the source tree is cleaned up.
